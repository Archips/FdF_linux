# FdF (linux version)

## Project Highlights

- **Objective:** This project involves creating a wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape using the MiniLibX graphical library.

- **Representation:** The project aims to visualize landscapes by connecting points (x, y, z) with line segments (edges) to create a 3D wireframe model.

- **Key Features:**
  - Render the model in isometric projection.
  - Read landscape coordinates from a .fdf file.
  - Use MiniLibX for window management and graphical elements.
  - Additional projection method (e.g. parallel).
  - Zoom in and out functionality.
  - Translation of the 3D model.
  - Rotation of the 3D model.
  - Chang the color of the map.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2. Navigate to the project directory.  
3. Compile the source files using the provided Makefile.
4. Run the program, specifying a .fdf file as input:
   `./fdf [map].fdf`
6. The program will display the 3D wireframe model of the landscape in a graphical window.
7. To close the window and exit the program, either press the "ESC" key or click the window's close button.
